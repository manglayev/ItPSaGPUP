in order to run particular java example:
1) go to the directory (e.g. cd /Lecture_1/Example_3)
2) list the files in the directory (e.g. ls)
3) compile each file (e.g. javac Example_3.java, javac Example_3_Main.java or javac *.java)
4) run the main file (java Example_3_Main [do not type .java])


file with the main class should be compiled last

compile with the file name + extension (javac Example_3.java)
run with the file name (java Example_3_Main)


in order to run particular cuda example:
1) go to the directory (e.g. cd /Lecture_7/Example_3)
2) run make all
3) run ./main
4) you can remove compiled .o files with make clean
